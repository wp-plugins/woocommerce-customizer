Helps you customize WooCommerce without writing any code!

== Description ==

WooCommerce includes a lot of filters so you can customize button text, labels, and more -- but you have to write PHP
code to use them. This plugin provides a settings page where you can add your customizations and save them without
needing to write any code or modify any templates, which is helpful for quick change testing.

Here's the list of customizations you can make:

*   Add to Cart button text for all product types (within the shop loop and on a single product page)
*   The number of products displayed per page
*   Heading text for the 'Product Description' and 'Additional Information' tab.
*   Checkout page coupon / login text
*   Checkout page "Create Account" checkbox default
*   Checkout page 'Submit Order' button text
*   Tax Label text
*   Placeholder image source

== Installation ==

1. Upload `woocommerce-customizer` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to 'Customizer' under the WooCommerce menu
4. Start customizing!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
